# 📡 Simulation of a Network Infrastructure Design for Amsic Integrated School

This repository contains the complete documentation and simulation files for our capstone project titled **"Simulation of a Network Infrastructure Design for Amsic Integrated School."** The project focuses on designing and simulating a reliable and scalable network infrastructure to support the school’s academic and administrative operations.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

Amsic Integrated School currently lacks a structured network infrastructure. To address this, we developed a cost-efficient simulated network design that ensures reliable connectivity, supports future scalability, and includes redundancy features to minimize downtime in case of failure.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Analyze existing infrastructure requirements  
- Design and simulate a network infrastructure tailored to the school’s needs, including:  
  - 📶 Wireless Network Implementation  
  - ⚖️ Load Balancing  
  - ♻️ Redundancy  
  - 📈 Scalability and Performance  
  - 🔐 Security Measures  
- Conduct stress tests and performance evaluations using iPerf and other tools

---

## 👨‍💻 My Role – Lead Configurator

As the **Lead Configurator**, I was fully responsible for building the entire simulation environment from scratch, including:

- 🧠 Designing the full network topology  
- ⚙️ Configuring routers, switches, access points, and firewalls  
- 🌐 Setting up VLANs, DHCP, NAT, and routing protocols  
- 🔐 Implementing firewall rules and security policies  
- 🧪 Conducting simulation, performance tests, and stress tests using **iPerf**  
- 🛠️ Troubleshooting and optimizing for reliability and scalability  
- 🖥️ Using **Cisco Packet Tracer** and **EVE-NG** to simulate real-world environments
