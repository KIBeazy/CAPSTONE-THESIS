Simulation of a Network Infrastructure Design for Amsic Integrated School
This repository contains the complete documentation and simulation files for our capstone project titled "Simulation of a Network Infrastructure Design for Amsic Integrated School." The project focuses on designing and simulating a reliable and scalable network infrastructure to support the school’s academic and administrative operations.

Project Overview
Amsic Integrated School currently lacks a structured network infrastructure. To address this, we developed a cost-efficient simulated network design that ensures reliable connectivity, supports future scalability, and includes redundancy features to minimize downtime in case of failure.

Key Objectives
To address the needs of Amsic Integrated School by:

Analyzing existing infrastructure requirements

Designing and simulating a network infrastructure tailored to the school’s needs, including:
● Wireless Network Implementation
● Load Balancing
● Redundancy
● Scalability and Performance
● Security Measures

Conducting stress tests and performance evaluations of the proposed network using iPerf and other tools

My Role – Lead Configurator
As the Lead Configurator, I was fully responsible for building the entire simulation environment from the ground up. This includes:

Designing the complete network topology

Configuring all network devices, including routers, switches, wireless access points, and firewalls

Setting up VLANs, routing protocols, DHCP, NAT, and firewall rules

Implementing security policies and redundancy features

Simulating network behavior using Cisco Packet Tracer and EVE-NG

Conducting performance testing, stress testing (using iPerf), and troubleshooting

Ensuring the network met the goals of scalability, performance, and reliability

Tools Used
Cisco Packet Tracer

EVE-NG

Fortinet FortiGate

Zabbix

iPerf

Microsoft Word / Google Docs
